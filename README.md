Splunk log integration for EMC ViPR and CoprHD

Status:
This currently contains just the python code needed to enhance the existing Splunk REST API Modular Input app to request log files from EMC ViPR Controller(commercial version) and CoprHD(open source version).

Plan:
Future iterations will implement the entire process into the code, removing the dependency on the REST app, and possibly implement as a ViPR specific app for Splunk.

ToDo:
Instuctions for deploying this solution will be added soon.
